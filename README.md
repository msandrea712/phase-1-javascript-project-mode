Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns and try to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

How to Play

Open the "index.html" file in your web browser.
The game will display a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board.
The first player's symbol is "X," and the second player's symbol is "O."
Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to make their move.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins the game.
If all cells are filled, and no player has won, the game will end in a tie.
Game Rules

A player cannot make a move in a cell that is already occupied.
The game will automatically detect a win or a tie and display an alert message.
